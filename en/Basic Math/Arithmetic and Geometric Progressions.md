# Arithmetic Progression
A sequence of numbers is said to be in an `Arithmetic progression` if the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same. In simple terms, it means that the next number in the series is calculated by adding a fixed number to the previous number in the series. 

For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is an AP because the difference between any two consecutive terms in the series (common difference) is same (4 - 2 = 6 - 4 = 8 - 6 = 10 - 8 = 2).

**Facts about Arithmetic Progression :**

1. Initial term: In an arithmetic progression, the first number in the series is called the initial term.
2. Common difference: The value by which consecutive terms increase or decrease is called the `common difference`.
3. The behavior of the arithmetic progression depends on the common difference `d`. If the common difference is positive, then the members (terms) will grow towards positive infinity, but if the common difference is negative, then the members (terms) will grow towards negative infinity.

**Formula of nth term of an A.P :**

If `a` is the initial term and `d` is the common difference.Thus, the explicit formula is:

**General Formulas to solve problems related to Arithmetic Progressions:** If `a` is the first term and `d` is the common difference:

- **nth term of an AP** = `a + (n-1)*d`.
- **Arithmetic Mean** = `Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP`.
- **Sum of ‘n’ terms** of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = `0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ]`.

# Geometric Progression

A sequence of numbers is said to be in a `Geometric progression` if the ratio of any two consecutive terms is always the same. In simple terms, it means that the next number in the series is calculated by multiplying a fixed number to the previous number in the series. 

For example, 2, 4, 8, 16 is a GP because ratio of any two consecutive terms in the series (common ratio) is the same (4 / 2 = 8 / 4 = 16 / 8 = 2).

**Facts about Geometric Progression :**

1. **Initial term:** In a geometric progression, the first number is called the initial term.
2. **Common ratio:** The ratio of any two consecutive terms by taking the previous term in the denominator.
3. The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio. If the common ratio is:

- Positive, the terms will all be of the same sign as the initial term.
- Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative.
- Greater than 1, there will be exponential growth towards positive or negative infinity (depending on the sign of the initial term).
- 1, the progression is a constant sequence.
- Between -1 and 1 but not zero, there will be exponential decay towards zero.
- -1, the progression is an alternating sequence.
- Less than -1, for the absolute values there is exponential growth towards (unsigned) infinity, due to the alternating sign.

**Formula of nth term of a Geometric Progression :** If `a` is the first term and `r` is the common ratio. Thus, the explicit formula is:

**General Formulas to solve problems related to Geometric Progressions:**

If `a` is the first term and `r` is the common ratio:
nth term of a GP = `a*rn-1`.
- Geometric Mean = `nth root of the product of n terms in the GP`.
- Sum of `n` terms of a GP (r < 1) = `[a (1 – rn)] / [1 – r]`.
- Sum of `n` terms of a GP (r > 1) = `[a (rn – 1)] / [r – 1]`.
- Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = `(a) / (1 – r)`.
